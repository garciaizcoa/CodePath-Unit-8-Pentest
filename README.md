# Pen Testing Live Targets

Time spent: 6 hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:

* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each color is vulnerable to only 2 of the 6 possible exploits. First discover which color has the specific vulnerability, then write a short description of how to exploit it, and finally demonstrate it using screenshots compiled into a GIF.

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection

Description:
SQL Injection in the ./public/staff/salespeople/show.php?id=?? path. Replacing the id value for an SQL query like ' OR SLEEP(5)=0--' so the code runs and pauses the site for 5 seconds.

## Red

Vulnerability #1: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

Description:

## Notes

Due to the large number of users trying to actively hack the site some vulnerabilities were changing while exploiting them.
